# Frontend Data


## Journal

### Day 1
On this day Titus told us about what we were going to do in the next 2 weeks. What also happened is that Emma came by to talk about data visualisations and gave us tips.

Then

### Day 2
This day started with a stand-up that May organised.
My plan for this day was that I was going to collect all the data that I needed. This didn't go as smooth as planned, because everyone was sending so many requests at the same time so a lot of people kept getting a 503 error.

I also did some sketching on this day to find out what type of graph I was going to make.

### day 3
feedbackgesprek met laurens over mn idee
leon van de korte van de correspondent
data veel ophalen



### day 4
zaten aan een tafel want mochten niet in normale ruimte
eindelijk bars in d3
proberen alleen de value van man te pakken maar lukt niet
hle klas idee verteld aan elkaar, tot 6 op school daardoor
feedback:
- top 10 van verschillende tijd periodes met elkaar vergelijken
- dropdown met mannen en vrouwen heeft niet echt nut

### day 5

kan door wouter alleen de value van man pakken met obj.find
bars groter
percentage berekend in js en die tonren in de bar chart
bars niet meer upside down
aantal mannen en aantla vrouwen in een const gezet
workshop tim over d3 nest
workshop laurens over tijd
workshop titus over communicatie (github slack pull requests en issues enzo)

On this day I made sure I could get just the value of of men using object.find. Wouter helped me with this. After I had done this, I could also get the value of woman and the total

After I had the value of men I could use that value in my bar chart. At this point the bars were the height of the amount of books written by a man per genre. This was good, but what I needed was the __percentage__ of books. I was going to do that at a different point.

What I wanted to do first was make sure my bars were'nt upside down anymore. Wouter helped me do this.
